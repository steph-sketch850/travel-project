                        Oregon is one of the most geographically diverse states in the U.S., marked by volcanoes,

                        forests, and high deserts. The state is also known for its abundant waterways, which include
                        the
                        Columbia River, the Snake River, and the Willamette River. Oregon's economy is largely
