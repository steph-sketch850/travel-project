                        Oregon is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located on the
                        west coast of the United States and is bordered by Washington to the north, Idaho to the east,
                        Nevada
                        to the southeast, and California to the south. The Columbia River delineates much of Oregon's
                        northern boundary with Washington, while the Snake River delineates much of its eastern boundary
                        with Idaho.

                        Oregon is one of the most geographically diverse states in the U.S., marked by volcanoes, dense
                        forests, and high deserts. The state is also known for its abundant waterways, which include the
                        Columbia River, the Snake River, and the Willamette River. Oregon's economy is largely
                        agriculture-based, with a focus on sustainable practices and organic farming.
